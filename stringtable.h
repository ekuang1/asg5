     static string identifier so that an assertion can be used to
     check the validity of the node.  Also, the number of elements in

     table needs doubling.  Other fields if needed.*/

     followed by spaces, then the hash number (%12u), and then the
     strings in %s format inside quotes in a column.  In the above
     example, the two strings in bucket 24 have collided.  It will

     is no difference between insert and lookup.  If the key is not
     found, it is inserted then returned.  If it is found, the
     existing node reference is returned.

     The argument string is copied onto the heap with strdup(3), since
     the second argument is a loan argument, not a transfer of
     ownership argument.  You may of course use malloc(3) and
